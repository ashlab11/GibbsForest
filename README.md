# Gibbs Forest

Code for Gibbs Forest, an tree ensemble algorithm with splits decided at the forest level, not the tree. I'm actively working on this project, as well as on a similar one that analyzes different methods for binning in LGBM. Check out the issues tab for current problems I'm working on fixing (mostly stuff dedicated to making this faster), as well as [this file](https://github.com/ashlab11/GibbsForest/blob/main/scripts/openmlexperiment.py) for info on the tests I'm running to compare Gibbs with generic tree-boosting methods.
